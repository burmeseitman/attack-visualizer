# Attack Visualizer

A Python-based educational web app that visually simulates common attack patterns in a safe lab context.

## Simulations
- Brute force password guessing (capped attempt simulation)
- SQL injection behavior (unsafe query vs parameterized query)
- Real-time charts and animated logs for classroom/demo use
- Defensive guidance and mitigation checklist

## Important Safety Note
This project is for **education and defensive awareness only**.
It does not execute real attacks and should never be used for unauthorized activity.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3 (standard library only)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with hacker-style UI

## Run
```bash
cd attack-visualizer
python3 app.py
```

Then open:
